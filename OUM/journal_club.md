Note: Welcome everyone to the presentation. Introduce the topic and briefly mention that the study investigates disaccharidase deficiencies and their link to GI symptoms.

# Background

**Disaccharidases** are enzymes located in the small intestine that break down complex sugars.  
- Enzymes involved: **lactase, maltase, sucrase, isomaltase, glucoamylase**.
- Deficiencies can cause **malabsorption** leading to **GI symptoms** such as:
  - Bloating
  - Diarrhea
  - Abdominal pain

---

# Common Deficiencies

- **Lactase deficiency**: Most common cause of lactose intolerance.
- **Sucrase-Isomaltase deficiency (SID)**: Results in starch and sucrose malabsorption.
- **Less Common**: Maltase and glucoamylase deficiencies.

Note: Explain how these enzyme deficiencies are clinically relevant because they lead to malabsorption and symptoms similar to IBS.

---

# Study Rationale

- Growing evidence links enzyme deficiencies to **Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)**.
- Disaccharidase deficiencies are often **underdiagnosed** in adults.
- **Objective**: Investigate the prevalence and association between disaccharidase deficiency and GI symptoms.

---

# Study Objectives

**Primary Objective**  
- Determine the **prevalence** of disaccharidase deficiencies in patients with GI symptoms undergoing gastroscopy.

**Secondary Objective**  
- Explore the relationship between enzyme deficiencies and **GI symptom severity** and **IBS**.

---

# Methods

**Study Population**  
- 40 patients referred for gastroscopy at Lovisenberg Diaconal Hospital (Oslo, Norway).

**Inclusion Criteria**  
- Referred for suspected GI disorder and undergoing routine gastroscopy.

**Exclusion Criteria**  
- No significant exclusion criteria.

**Biopsy Sampling**  
- Pinch biopsies taken from the **distal duodenum**.

Note: Explain the patient selection process and the rationale behind using the Dahlqvist method for measuring enzyme activity.

---

# Biopsy and Enzyme Activity Measurement

- **Dahlqvist Method**: Used to measure disaccharidase activity.
- Biopsies homogenized, and enzyme activity measured for:
  - **Lactase**
  - **Maltase**
  - **Sucrase**
  - **Isomaltase**
  - **Glucoamylase**

Note: The Dahlqvist method is a standard assay for measuring enzyme activity. Here, three pinch biopsies from the distal duodenum were used for analysis.

---

# Symptom Assessment

**IBS Diagnosis**: Based on **Rome IV criteria**.  
- Symptoms like **abdominal pain**, changes in stool frequency, and form over the last 3 months.

**Symptom Severity**: Measured using **IBS Symptom Severity Score (IBS-SSS)**:
- Scale: Mild (75–175), Moderate (175–300), Severe (>300).

Note: Explain how the study categorized GI symptoms using the IBS-SSS score. This scale gives a quantitative measure of symptom severity.

---

# Key Results

- **60%** of patients had disaccharidase deficiencies.
  - Most common: **Lactase deficiency (55%)**.
  - 20% had **deficiency in all enzymes**.
- **Symptom Severity**: 75% of patients reported moderate to severe symptoms.
- No significant correlation between disaccharidase deficiency and **IBS diagnosis**.

Note: Highlight the surprising result that disaccharidase deficiencies were common, but there wasn’t a strong link to IBS diagnosis or symptom severity.

---

# Results Breakdown

- **Disaccharidase Deficiency**:
  - 24 patients (60%) had deficiencies in one or more enzymes.
  - Lactase was most frequently deficient (22 patients, 55%).
  
- **IBS Prevalence**: 
  - IBS present in 54% of patients with enzyme deficiency vs. 50% without.

# Association Between Enzyme Deficiency and Symptoms

- **No significant association** between enzyme levels and GI symptom severity.
- Both patients with and without disaccharidase deficiency reported **moderate to severe** symptoms.

Note: Emphasize that while disaccharidase deficiency was prevalent, its relationship with symptoms was unclear, suggesting other factors may be involved.

# Figure: Disaccharidase Deficiency vs GI Symptom Severity

- **Question**: Does disaccharidase deficiency affect GI symptom severity?
- **Finding**: No clear pattern observed.

Note: Use this figure to demonstrate the comparison between symptom severity and enzyme levels.

# Discussion & Conclusion

- **Main Findings**: Disaccharidase deficiencies are common but **not strongly correlated** with IBS or GI symptom severity.
- **Strengths**:
  - First study to measure enzyme activity in adults undergoing routine gastroscopy.
  - Biochemical confirmation of enzyme deficiency.
- **Weaknesses**:
  - **Small sample size** (40 patients).
  - Single-center study, limiting generalizability.

---

# Study Strengths

- **Objective biochemical measures** of enzyme activity.
- Focus on **adult patients**, which is less commonly studied compared to pediatric populations.

![Placeholder for Strength Image]()

Note: Mention that the study fills an important gap by investigating disaccharidase deficiency in adults with GI complaints.

---

# Study Weaknesses

- **Sample size**: Limited generalizability due to only 40 patients.
- **No dietary data**: GI symptoms could be influenced by diet, not just enzyme activity.
- **Biopsy location**: Only **distal duodenum** samples were used, which may not capture variations in enzyme activity across the intestine.

![Placeholder for Weakness Image]()

Note: Critical evaluation should focus on the limitations that may affect the interpretation of the findings.

---

# Clinical Relevance

- Routine testing for **disaccharidase deficiencies** may not be justified based on these findings.
- **Dietary adjustments** (e.g., lactose restriction) could still benefit specific patients, but routine testing may not be necessary for all.

Note: Emphasize that the clinical take-home is that enzyme testing should be selective, not routine.

---

# Key Takeaways

- **Disaccharidase deficiencies are common**, particularly lactase deficiency.
- **No strong correlation** between enzyme deficiency and GI symptom severity.
- More research is needed to explore other factors influencing GI symptoms.
